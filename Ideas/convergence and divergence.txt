what the sigma do i do
1. talk about what convergence/divergence actually is
2. different sequences
- maybe harmonic series? how it may diverge
   - proof of harmonic diverging: dont use integral its a goddamn 5 yr old, perhaps assign it a value and show the value doesn't exist
- famous 1/2 + 1/4 + ... = 1 proof geometrically or smth idfk
- when do GP diverge?
- when do GP converge?
- proof of GP sum
- proof of a/1-r
- use this to prove some other results, note that |r|<1
3. what the sigma? what happens here!
- talk about assigning values to divergent functions
- weird results
- Ramanujan's stuff
- try out 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... and so on, show it diverges first though
   - what the sigma is the value yo
- again, try out 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ... and so on lol
- weird results.. op
